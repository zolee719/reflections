How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    We will be able to see how it developed by time, like evolution.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Yes there are. It is necessary to save on time automatically, because we can loose our sense of time and forget about it.

files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It is the matter of how to work together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
